# Day 5: Player Interaction and Game Menus

## Introduction

Interactivity is a cornerstone of any game. Today, we’ll:
1. Introduce buttons and touch interactions.
2. Create a simple main menu to start the game.
3. Implement pause and resume functionality.

## Why Interactivity Matters

Interactivity turns static visuals into an engaging experience. Key components include:
- **Touch Controls**: Allow players to influence the game world.
- **Menus**: Provide intuitive navigation and control.
- **Game State Management**: Pause, resume, and restart gameplay seamlessly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Main Menu

1. Add a new `MenuView` class to display buttons (e.g., "Start Game").
2. Use `TextView` or `Button` widgets for menu options.
3. Switch to the game view when a button is tapped.

Refer to `MenuView.kt` for implementation details.

### Step 2: Handle Touch Events in the Game

1. Override the `onTouchEvent` method in `GameView`.
2. Track the player's touch position.
3. Respond to taps or swipes to move the ball or trigger actions.

### Step 3: Add Pause and Resume Functionality

1. Introduce a "Pause" button.
2. Use a flag to control game state (paused or running).
3. Stop animations and physics updates when paused.

Refer to `GameView.kt` for implementation details.

## Practice Exercise

Expand the program to:
1. Add a "Restart Game" button in the menu.
2. Display the player's score when the game is paused.
3. Allow the player to drag the ball using touch gestures.

Hints:
- Use `onTouchEvent` to track touch movements.
- Maintain a score variable and update it during gameplay.
