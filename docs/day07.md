# Day 7: Animations and Sound Effects

## Introduction

Today, we will enhance the game's experience by:
1. Adding animations to the player and obstacles.
2. Integrating sound effects for actions like scoring, collisions, and game events.
3. Combining animations and sounds to make gameplay more immersive.

---

## Animations

Animations bring life to static game elements. We will:
1. Use Android’s `ValueAnimator` and `ObjectAnimator` classes for smooth transitions.
2. Apply animations to the player and obstacles.

---

## Sound Effects

Sound effects provide instant feedback to the player. Steps to integrate:
1. Use `SoundPool` for lightweight audio effects.
2. Trigger sounds for scoring and collision events.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Add Animations

1. Create a pulsing animation for the player (scale up and down).
2. Animate obstacle colors to shift dynamically.

---

### Step 2: Integrate Sound Effects

1. Prepare sound assets (`score.wav`, `collision.wav`).
2. Initialize `SoundPool` in your game.
3. Play sounds based on events like scoring and collisions.

---

### Step 3: Combine Animations and Sounds

1. Synchronize animations and sounds for key events.
2. Ensure seamless integration without affecting performance.

---

## Practice Exercise

Enhance the program by:
1. Creating a background music loop using `MediaPlayer`.
2. Adding a countdown timer animation before the game starts.
3. Customizing animations for different obstacle types.

---

## Summary

Today, you learned to:
1. Use animations to enhance visual feedback.
2. Add sound effects for better user interaction.
3. Combine visual and audio elements to make your game immersive.
